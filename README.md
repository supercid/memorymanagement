# Memory Management Comparison
These are very old sources, i think i wrote them somewhere back in 2012. <br>
The aim of this project is to measure how fast some C++ data structures are in different operating systems.
You can find the sources in the src folder. <br>
The plots can be made using **gnuplot**.
